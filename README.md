# Geographic Impact on Stock Market Performance: A Case Study

## Executive Summary

This project explores the intriguing effect of geographic location on stock market performance. With advancements in data availability and analytical tools, we delve into how regional economic dynamics shape stock returns. Our study hypothesizes that understanding geographic influences can significantly enhance decision-making in stock market investments. We utilize stock price data from Yahoo! Finance and financial disclosures from EDGAR to explore the specific impacts of regional economic activities on the markets.

### Regional Classification

The United States is categorized into five regions for this analysis:
- Northeast
- West
- Midwest
- Southeast
- Southwest

### Initial Findings

Our analysis reveals that while stocks in the Northeast and West show higher biweekly returns on average, these figures are skewed by a few high-performing stocks rather than reflective of the regional markets as a whole.

### Methodology

We employ a range of analytics:
- **Descriptive Analytics** (summary statistics and visualizations)
- **Diagnostic Analytics** (analysis of anomalies and variance)
- **Predictive Analytics** (regression models and cluster analysis)
- **Prescriptive Analytics** (optimization models for geographic diversification)

### Investment Strategies

Based on our comprehensive analysis, we propose two main investment strategies:
1. **Southwestern Focus**: Invest heavily in the Southwest with a minor allocation to the West to achieve the best risk-return balance.
2. **Target High-Performers in Northeast and West**: Concentrate on specific high-performing stocks in these regions to maximize returns without regional market risks.

## Report Details

### Data Sources
- **Yahoo! Finance**: Provides stock prices including close prices from 2015 to 2020.
- **EDGAR**: Offers geographic information derived from company 10-K filings at the state level.

### Analytical Process
1. **Descriptive Analytics**: Utilize various statistical measures to understand stock performance across geographic locations.
2. **Diagnostic Analytics**: Identify and investigate performance outliers and conduct variance analysis.
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Employ regression and clustering to forecast and group stock performance trends.
4. **Prescriptive Analytics**: Develop models to optimize stock selections based on geographic data.
